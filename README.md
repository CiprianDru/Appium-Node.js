# Appium-Node.js

Prerequisites to use Appium:

1.Android SDK (Android Studio with bundled SDK).
2.JDK (Java Development Kit).
3.Appium Client for Windows (client).
4.IDE and testing framework of choice. In our case, we will use node.js and mocha testing frameworks, so we need to install js. Even though Appium client supplied with bundled “Node.exe” and NPM (node package manager), we will install those manually to have the latest version.

Appium installation on Mac

Download and install JDK. After installation, you will need to set your “JAVA_HOME” environment variable.
